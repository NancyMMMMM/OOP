# OOP
1. Encapsulation (Reduce complexity + Increase reusability)
   When functions initialized with parameters, OOP provides a way to reduce the numbers of parameters by adding properties to object, then build the properties in method as a unit.
2. Abstraction (Reduce complexity + Isolate impact of changes)
   1) Simpler interface
      By building 
   2) Reduce the impact of changes
3. Inheritance (Elimiate reduant code)
   By define generic object, elimiating reduant code 
4. Polymorphism (Refactor ugly switch/case statement)
